# Computer Vision and Image Processing

This repository is a collection of computer vision algorithms that I've learned and tried to implement. It contains everything from implementations of homework assignments for [Purdue's ECE 661 Course](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/computervision/ECE661Folder/Index.html) taught by Avi Kak, to basic implementations of algorithms from OpenCV.

My goal is to use the repository as an assessment ground for algorithms and for storing projects that delve into computer vision without explicitly being deep learning projects.

## Current Projects:
 * harris-corners
 * projective-rectification
