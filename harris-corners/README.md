# Harris Corner Detection

This project was created as an alternative to the easy-to-use, fast, and efficient OpenCV `cornerHarris()` function. But why would we do something fast and efficiently, when we can learn it from the ground up and apply it in a frustratingly slow way? There are two version of the same program to compare these performances:

 * `builtin.py`
 * `harris.py`

`harris.py` was built for the purpose of this project and represents a manual creation and application of the harris corner detection algorithm written iteratively. `builtin.py`, on the other hand, accomplishes the same tasks, but does so using OpenCV's builtin `cornerHarris()` function.
